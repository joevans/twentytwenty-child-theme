# My Child Theme

Goals: Looking to have a quickly update-able place for my theme to live while I make edits to it through multiple places. Additionally, I am looking for that sweet, sweet versioning.

This theme should be a child theme for the twenty twenty theme. It does not use full site blocking but it is expected to utilize blocks via ACF.

Other typical plugins used:
- *Gravity Forms*
- *ACF Pro* (for blocks)
- *Autoptimize* for site caching
- Page duplication plugin
